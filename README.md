# Advanced Data Science Course - Final Project


We wanted to find the effect of the following indices on agricultural output:

1. Population
2. Labor (Agricultural Employees)
3. Climate Change (Temperature & Avg Rainfall)
4. Amount of Pesticides used by farmers
5. Producer Crop Price
6. Land use (Land price)


In order to find the effects of the mentioned above indicies we used various of statistical tools such as:

1. Anderson Darling Normality Test to assess the normality of the distribution
2. GMM (Gaussian Mixed Model) to assess the distribution of each cluster in our data (response variable was bi-modal)
3. Linear regression
4. Kendall Correlation Test

In addition, we also used visualization tools like ggplot2 (Scatter plots & histograms) to get an understanding on the relation between our independent variables and our dependent variable (agricultural output) and qqplots to assess the distribution of our response variable.


I hope you enjoy our work!
